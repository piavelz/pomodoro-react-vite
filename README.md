# Pomodoro Timer - React + Vite

Pomodoro is a popular time management technique that alternates periods of focused work with short breaks. 

This Pomodoro Timer allows users to customize the length of their work and break intervals, helping them maintain productivity throughout the day.



## Description

This Pomodoro Timer provides a user-friendly interface where you can input your desired focus and break durations. The timer will then manage these cycles, displaying the remaining time for each session until it reaches zero. Once the timer ends, users can reset and start a new cycle. The application is built using modern technologies to ensure speed and responsiveness.
